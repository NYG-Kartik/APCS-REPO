 Spent: 0.5 hrs


DISCO
 - most of the methods are one liners!
 - toString() methods are hard to implement though

QCC
 - what are you supposed to return if something is empty?
 - are most stacks implemented using list implementations this easy?
 
 API Is key
 - Knowing what methods for AL AND LL java already has makes it way easier to plan.
