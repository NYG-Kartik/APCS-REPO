DISCOS:
- Implementing the remove method was fairly easy. We used the peekMin to find the min value and set it's index as the input for ArrayList's remove method.
- There was no peekMax so we used the peekMin for the index.
- Planning helped.

QCCs:
- Is there a way to implement remove with a smaller time complexity?
- How many total subcases?
- In an encapsulation diagram, can you put all methods you think you will need or only the ones that are needed in the class?
