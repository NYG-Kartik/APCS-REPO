DISCOS:
- Importing random things is not good.
- Main method implementation should have been very simple.. 
- No guess limits in this game made it a bit simpler to understand.

QCC: 
- GUI RUnner was bugging a little
- WHy aren't there guess limits?
- WOuld the GUI RUnner bug out if the user puts too many guesses?
- How many clues given before the computer moves on to the next celeb?
