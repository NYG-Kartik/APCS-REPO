- Compile-time errors indicate that there is something wrong with the syntax of the program. Example: omitting the semicolon at the end of a statement.
- Run-time errors are produced if something goes wrong while the program is running.
- Logic errors cause the program to do the wrong thing.
- Best debugging is the one you do not do because you produce good code from the very start.
- If there are a lot of errors, make sure to take a deep breath, then go through the code and look for common syntax errors, like missing parentheses
and semi colons. 
- If a loop seems to be "hanging" that is a sign that there is a run time error within the recursive loop and that the loop is an infinite loop and it doesnt 
have a base case, and that the loop keeps going out of bounds. 
- This usually leads the compiler to display a StackOverflow error message.
- Sometimes while compiling, there can be exceptions printed as errrs these exceptions are as follows:
NullPointerException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
StackOverflowError
FileNotFoundException
ArithmeticException
- If an exception does pop up, identify it, and take proper steps to try to ressolve the exceptions. 
- Sometimes, simplifying outputs by combining print statements helps. 
- With logic errors, you need to identify what is wrong by having a mental map of your code, and trying to find an error with what your code was 
supposed to  be doing versus what it is able to accomplish as of right now. 
- With complex expressions, breaking them up can help, as well as just making it simple as possible to make it easy as possible to find errors. 
- Changing print to println can help some things that are not getting printed to get printed.
- Ask these questions when encountering an error:  
What kind of bug is it? Compile-time, run-time, or logic?
What was the last thing you did before this error occurred? What were the last lines of code that you wrote, or what is the test case that fails?
If the bug occurs at compile time or run time, what is the error message, and what part of the program does it indicate?
What have you tried, and what have you learned?
- DUCKY IS VERY IMPORTANT!!
- Learn from the bugs.
