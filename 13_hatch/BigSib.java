HW 13 Where Do Big Sibs Come From
2021-10-06
DISCO: I discovered that a constructor does not need a lot of properties 
inside of it, it only needs the tasks that need to be done after the class
name.
QCC: What is the best or proper way to form a constructor?
Is the class name in this case Greet?
Does String message and string message2 call to what i said in the other 
file?
*/
public class BigSib {
  public static void setHelloMsg (String message) {
     System.out.println (message); }
      public static String greet (String message2) { 
       return message2;
}}
