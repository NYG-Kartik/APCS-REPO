HW 13 Where Do Big Sibs Come From
2021-10-06
DISCO: I discovered that a constructor does not need a lot of properties
inside of it, it only needs the tasks that need to be done after the class
name.
QCC: What is the best or proper way to form a constructor?
Is the class name in this case Greet?
Does String message and string message2 call to what i said in the other 
file?
*/
public class Greet {
   (String message, String message2)
  {
     Word = message;
     up freshman = message2;

  //end main()
}} //end Greet
