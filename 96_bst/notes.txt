DISCOS:
- Most of the work for the height and numLeaves methods went into making sure we had the right conditionals that accounted for every scenario.
- Depth greater makes it harder to measure.

QCCs:
- Is there another way to implement height and numLeaves without a helper method that takes a treeNode parameter?
- What if the depth and height are really great?
