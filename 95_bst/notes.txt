DISCO
------------------------------------------------
* Instance variables setup already.
* Infinite trees from a traversal.
* Returning works. 
* New methods need tracing.
================================================


QCC
------------------------------------------------
* How can you set another value for cargo?
* Is this the user input?
* Is depth referring to every level?
================================================

With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

1. a perfect binary tree has (2^L)-1 nodes.
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^(L-1) nodes.
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is log base 2 (n+1) - 1.
